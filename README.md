# Data-Driven Hypothesis Validation: How Social Connections Boost Mood

## About This Project
Ever wondered if spending time with friends and family really lifts your spirits? This project dives into real-world data to explore exactly that! By analyzing daily activity logs across an entire week, we uncover how social interactions correlate with mood‚Äîturning raw numbers into meaningful insights.

## The Data
Our treasure trove is a multi-sheet Excel workbook packed with daily diaries detailing activities, social encounters, moods, and more. Each sheet captures a slice of life over several weeks, ready to reveal the secrets of happiness.

## What I Did
- Cleaned and transformed data from multiple sheets with a robust Python pipeline.
- Crafted clever features to spot social moments by detecting mentions of ‚Äúfriend‚Äù or ‚Äúfamily.‚Äù
- Calculated average mood scores and tallied weekly social interactions.
- Created vibrant scatterplots that visualize the uplifting connection between social time and mood.

## Tools of the Trade
- Python 3.x
- Pandas for seamless data wrangling
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for eye-catching visualizations

## How to Explore
1. Pop your `data.xlsx` file into the project folder.
2. Run the script or notebook (`hypothesis_validation.py`) to watch the magic unfold.
3. Enjoy the colorful plot illustrating how friends and family brighten our days.

## What I Found
Turns out, the more social interactions, the better the mood! This intuitive relationship shines through the data, supporting the age-old wisdom that good company truly makes us happier.

## Next Steps
- Add formal statistical tests for deeper validation.
- Explore more detailed activity and mood patterns.
- Build an interactive dashboard for easy, insightful data exploration.
